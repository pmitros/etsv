          <h3> TSVx: Enhanced TSV Format </h3>

<p> TSV is a nice format. It's human-readable, very fast to parse, and
concise. It's possible to process as a streaming format.

<p> It's also painfully hard to work with due to lack of
standardization. Each file requires a different set of heuristics to
load. In addition, the columns must be parsed in a different way for
every file.

<p> If this proposal is successful, ideally, e.g. a spreadsheet would be
able to open a MySQL export without prompting the user for help, and
pandas would be able to work with both.

<p> This is a prototype for working with an enhanced TSV format. tsvx
files are a tab-seprated format, with several extensions:

  <ul>
<li> We standardize escaping. We use JSON-style escaping.
<li> We standardize column types to be JSON variables. We support
  more types encoded as such
<li> We standardize on headers which can provide column names and type
  metadata. Columns may have types, units, and similar
</ul>

<p> This is repository includes (at the time of this writing, the start
of) a parser for such tab-separated files. 

  <h3>Example file</h2>

<pre>
    title: Food inventory
    description: A sample TSVx file
    created-date: '2016-10-29T15:25:29.449640'
    generator: test.py
    ---------------------
    Food Name	Weight	Price	Expiration Date
    var:	foodname	weight	price	expiration
    types:	str	int	float	ISO8601-date
    units:	None	kg	dollars/kg	ISO8601-date
    json-types:	String	Number	Number	String
    mysql-types:	VARCHAR(80)	SMALLINT	DOUBLE	VARCHAR(20)
    ---------------------
    Tuna	300	5.13	2017-10-12
    Salmon	150	7.13	2018-10-12
</pre>

<p> The file has three sections:

  <ul>
<li> Metadata (optional)
<li> Headers (required)
<li> Data (required)

<p> Sections are seperated by a line of all dashes, containing at least
<p> three dashes.

<p> The metadata is a YAML dictionary. The first line must contain a
colon. Fields defined are:

  <ul>
<li> title -- A single line title/description
<li> description -- A multiline description
<li> authors  -- JSON list of authors
<li> created-date -- ISO8601 date and time of when the file was created
<li> modified-date -- ISO8601 date and time of last modification
<li> generator -- Some identifier of the program or source the data came
  from
</ul>
  
<p> First line of the headers are human-readable column headers. Following
lines define additional information about each column. Required are
types and json-types, which say how the data ought to be
interpreted. Currently defined types are:

  <ul>
<li> int -- Integer
<li> float -- Floating point number, either containing a space or otherwise
<li> bool -- Boolean
<li> ISO8601-datetime -- Date and time as 2014-12-30T11:59:00.01
<li> ISO8601-date -- Date as 2014-12-30
<li> str -- JSON-encoded string (quotes omitted)
  </ul>
  
<p>JSON types are String, Number, or Boolean.
