	  <h3>tsvx: Strictly typed TSV format with metadata</h3>
<p>TSV is a nice format. It's human-readable, very fast to parse, and
concise. It's possible to process as a streaming format.</p>
<p>It's also painfully hard to work with due to lack of standardization
and typing. Each file requires a different set of heuristics to
interpret. Those heuristics might break 80GB into a 100GB file, when
an oddball case comes up. Those heuristics also translate into a
tremendous amount of unnecessary ETL work. Even importing a TSV/CSV
into a spreadsheet causes a dialog to pop up.</p>
<p>This is a proposal for an enhanced TSV format. If this proposal is
successful, a spreadsheet would be able to open a MySQL export without
prompting the user for help, and most data will flow freely between
tools like pandas, tableau, R, and others (excepting issues of
formatting and precision).</p>
<p>tsvx files are a tab-separated format, where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Columns are statically typed, with declared types, and standardized
  string escaping, dates, and similar for other data types.</li>
<li>We standardize column headers which provide metadata about column
  names, types, and contents.</li>
<li>We standardize overall metadata for overall file description,
  providence, creation time, authors, and otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is repository includes a simple parser for such files so we can
experiment with this concept. It also includes scripts to export from
MySQL, both on a table level and on a whole database level.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>We have nice standards for documents (XML, as well as other markup
languages). We have nice standards for objects and configuration data
(YAML and JSON). While numerical and tabular data is becoming
increasingly important, we don't have any nice standards for
representing it; it is all very ad-hoc.</p>
<p>It is also increasingly being interchanged across tools. We see
organizations which have terabytes of data in systems like Hadoop and
Vertica, gigabytes in databases and flat files, and kilobytes of
hand-curated data in spreadsheets, all of which is integrated in
common systems.</p>
<p>Our design goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Human-readability</strong></li>
<li><strong>Compatibility</strong>. Excel, Google Docs, Hadoop, LibreOffice, MySQL,
  PostgreSQL, Python, R, Vertica, and other tools should open each
  other's imports and exports, maintaining basic type information
  without additional scripting.</li>
<li><strong>Simple parsing</strong>. Processing scripts are simpler and less
  brittle. With tsvx, adding a column or changing column order doesn't
  break scripts.</li>
<li><strong>In-Line Documentation</strong>. We have many TSV files sitting around,
  often years old, and no idea of what they contain, or how to
  regenerate them on current data.</li>
<li><strong>Backwards-compatibility</strong>. A tsvx file should open reasonably in
  spreadsheets unaware of tsvx</li>
<li><strong>Fast, single-pass processing</strong>. tsvx files are usable up to
  perhaps 10GB of data.</li>
<li><strong>Extensibility</strong>. If it becomes popular, it should be able to
  replace formats from tools like mysqldump with something less
  ad-hoc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Status</h3>
<p>We are in a <strong>request-for-comments period</strong>. If we decide this is a
good idea, we'll make this more production-ready, and perhaps draft an
IETF RFC or similar standard.</p>
<h3>File Structure</h3>
<p>The file has three sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File metadata</strong> (optional) -- Information about the file itself.</li>
<li><strong>Column headings</strong> (required) -- Metadata about the names and types
  in the columns</li>
<li><strong>Data</strong> (required) -- What one might traditionally find in a TSV
  file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sections are separated by a line of all dashes, containing at least
three dashes. If the first section is omitted, the file should start
with a line of dashes.</p>
<h3>File Metadata</h3>
<p>The metadata is a YAML dictionary. The first line must contain a
colon, but we recommend having all lines in this format. Standard
fields include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>authors</code> -- JSON list of authors</li>
<li><code>created-date</code> -- ISO8601 date and time of when the file was created</li>
<li><code>description</code> -- A multiline description</li>
<li><code>generator</code> -- Some identifier of the program or source which created
  the file</li>
<li><code>modified-date</code> -- ISO8601 date and time of last modification</li>
<li><code>title</code> -- A single line title/description</li>
</ul>
<h3>Headers/Column Metadata</h3>
<p>First line of the headers are human-readable column headers
(required). Following lines define additional information about each
column. Required is <code>types</code>, which says how the data ought to be
interpreted. Currently defined types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ISO8601-date</code> -- Date as <code>2014-12-30</code></li>
<li><code>ISO8601-datetime</code> -- Date and time as <code>2014-12-30T11:59:00.01</code></li>
<li><code>bool -- Boolean.</code>true<code>or</code>false`</li>
<li><code>float</code> -- Floating point number, either containing a space or otherwise</li>
<li><code>int</code> -- Integer</li>
<li><code>str</code> -- JSON-encoded string (quotes omitted)</li>
</ul>
<p>As a fallback, we strongly recommend a json section. All columns
should be defined as one of three JSON types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Boolean</code> -- <code>true</code> or <code>false</code></li>
<li><code>Number</code> -- Integer or floating point</li>
<li><code>String</code> -- Most other data types fall into this category</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is missing, parsers should treat unrecognized types as strings.</p>
<p><code>variables</code> is also strongly recommended. <code>variables</code> gives useful
variable names to assign in a program. These should be letters,
numbers, and underscores, but may not begin with a number. This is
convenient for automatic parsers and parser generators.</p>
<p>In addition, there may be headers for other metadata, such as units,
or vendor extensions.  </p>
<h3>Vendor Extensions</h3>
<p>Vendors may add arbitrary extensions to both metadata and headers. The
keys should begin with a program name and a dash. For example, <code>mysql</code>
could add rows called <code>mysql-types</code> and <code>mysql-keys</code> to the headers,
which would allow imports/exports to maintain both type information,
and which columns are unique. <code>mysql</code> could also place global column
metadata (such as multi-column constraints or storage engine) in the
file-wide metadata with keys such as <code>mysql-constraints</code> and
<code>mysql-engine</code>, or just in its own YAML section. </p>
<p>Such extensions should pay close attention to human readability.</p>
<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>This is a before-and-after example of the same code, with a TSV file
in Python, versus with a tsvx file and the library:</p>
<p>After:</p>
<pre><code>for line in tsvx.reader(open("file.tsvx"))
   do_some_stuff(line.foodname,
                 line.weight,
                 line.price,
                 line.expiration)
</code></pre>
<p>Before:</p>
<pre><code>f = open("file.tsv")
# Skip headers
f.next()
# Break on tabs
split_lines = (l[:-1].split('\t') for l in f)
# Parse to types
parsed_lines = (
   [l[0], int(l[1]), float(l[2]), dateutil.parser.parse(l[3])]
   for l in split_lines
)

for foodname, weight, price, expiration in parsed_lines:
   do_some_stuff(foodname, weight, price, expiration)
</code></pre>
<p>There is a also a small file in the repo, <code>example/example.py</code>, which
shows how the prototype reference library works. Note that both the
API and file format are still mutable -- we are actively soliciting
feedback.</p>
<h3>A More Complex File</h3>
<p>And a more complex example, to show how extension fit in:</p>
